### Thread

- `<ISO8601 UTC>` — **<display name or Reviewer>**: <review comment>

### Resolution

Unresolved. For `resolved` or `wont-fix`, replace this line with the resolution timestamp, optional display name, and summary from frontmatter.

<!--
Round-trip contract:
- The strict JSON object in frontmatter is canonical machine state and is also valid YAML.
- The Markdown body is a deterministic human-readable projection of that object, ordered by finding id and then message id.
- Publication must generate both in one write. Validation rejects a body whose finding ids, statuses, quotes, thread messages, or resolution summaries disagree with frontmatter.
- Drafts do not use this tracked template. They remain in machine-local Viewer storage until explicit publication.
