# Provider architecture

The web app communicates with the server via WebSocket using a simple JSON-RPC-style protocol:

- **Request/Response**: `{ id, method, params }` → `{ id, result }` or `{ id, error }`
- **Push events**: typed envelopes with `channel`, `sequence` (monotonic per connection), and channel-specific `data`

Push channels: `server.welcome`, `server.configUpdated`, `terminal.event`, `orchestration.domainEvent`. Payloads are schema-validated at the transport boundary (`wsTransport.ts`). Decode failures produce structured `WsDecodeDiagnostic` with `code`, `reason`, and path info.

Methods mirror the `NativeApi` interface defined in `@t3tools/contracts`:

- `providers.startSession`, `providers.sendTurn`, `providers.interruptTurn`
- `providers.respondToRequest`, `providers.stopSession`
- `shell.openInEditor`, `server.getConfig`

Implemented providers are registered as provider drivers on the server. Current built-in drivers include Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, and Pi.

Pi uses Pi RPC mode (`pi --mode rpc`) through the same provider session boundary as the other drivers. T3's in-app browser remains exposed through provider-scoped MCP `preview_*` tools; Pi consumes that server through the `pi-mcp-adapter` extension by receiving a scoped `--mcp-config` file plus a bearer token environment variable. The driver does not fall back to Pi `agent-browser`, global Chrome automation, or standalone Playwright.

## Client transport

`wsTransport.ts` manages connection state: `connecting` → `open` → `reconnecting` → `closed` → `disposed`. Outbound requests are queued while disconnected and flushed on reconnect. Inbound pushes are decoded and validated at the boundary, then cached per channel. Subscribers can opt into `replayLatest` to receive the last push on subscribe.

## Server-side orchestration layers

Provider runtime events flow through queue-based workers:

1. **ProviderRuntimeIngestion** — consumes provider runtime streams, emits orchestration commands
2. **ProviderCommandReactor** — reacts to orchestration intent events, dispatches provider calls
3. **CheckpointReactor** — captures git checkpoints on turn start/complete, publishes runtime receipts

All three use `DrainableWorker` internally and expose `drain()` for deterministic test synchronization.
