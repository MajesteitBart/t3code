# Delivery Plan: $name

## What Changed After Probe

## Technical Context

## Architecture Decisions

## Policy and Contract Checks
- [ ] \`.project\` remains the execution source of truth
- [ ] Probe decision is explicit
- [ ] Evidence gates are defined before handoff
- [ ] External sync writes require dry-run or operator approval

## Generated Artifact Map
- \`spec.md\`: <source or generation notes>
- \`plan.md\`: <source or generation notes>
- \`workstreams/\`: <source or generation notes>
- \`tasks/\`: <source or generation notes>

## Complexity Exceptions
- <exception, rationale, and owner>

## Probe-Driven Architecture Changes

## Workstream Design

## Milestone Strategy

## Rollout Strategy

## Test Strategy

## Rollback Strategy

## Remaining Delivery Risks
