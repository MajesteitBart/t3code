# Delano operating modes

Use operating modes to choose the lightest safe delivery contract. The mode should reduce ambiguity, not add ceremony.

| Mode | Slug              | Name                  | Best fit                                          | Minimum contract                                                                             |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | patch             | Patch                 | Tiny, low-risk fix with obvious validation        | Focused change plus validation evidence                                                      |
| 1    | scoped-change     | Scoped change         | Bounded task with clear acceptance criteria       | Task contract, acceptance criteria, local validation                                         |
| 2    | feature           | Feature               | Multi-step delivery with clear solution direction | Spec/plan, task sequence or workstream, validation gate                                      |
| 3    | uncertain-feature | Uncertain feature     | Feature with meaningful unknowns                  | Uncertainty statement, probe decision, probe evidence before build commitment                |
| 4    | multi-stream      | Multi-stream delivery | Concurrent streams or coordination/collision risk | Workstream map, conflict zones or leases, handoff summaries, sync/drift checks when relevant |

## Validation posture

`operating-modes.json` is the canonical machine-readable contract. `npm run check:operating-modes` verifies that modes 0 through 4 are present, ordered, uniquely named, and documented with requirements.

Modes are additive for now. Existing artifacts do not need an `operating_mode` field until stricter migration work lands.
